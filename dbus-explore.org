# # dbus-explore.el --- D-Bus tree-explorer  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

* About
This is a D-Bus explorer for emacs.

* Usage
As usual, add the file to load path and do a
=(require 'dbus-explore)=

=M-: (dbus-explore :system)=
or
=M-: (dbus-explore :session)=

Click the Nodes in the explorer Buffer to browse the objects and their interfaces.
* Implementation
D-Bus objects are represented in a tree fashion, using emacs' tree
widget in a separate buffer, with one top-level object for each known
D-Bus object.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'tree-widget)

#+END_SRC
** Variables
All DBus objects implement some standard interfaces, hide them per default.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar dbus-explore-hide-standard-interfaces t)
(defconst dbus-explore-standard-interfaces
  '( "org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties"
     "org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable"
     "org.freedesktop.DBus.Peer"
     "org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager"
     ))

** Tree Widget Creation
The tree items are created on button-click time by providing an
expander function to an item.  The general pattern here is to create
the expanders when the next item is created.  This expander-creation is
recursive, and creating lexical closures allows us to carry the
information that is needed for the next child-node in the closed-over
arguments for the next handler-creation.

The top-level nodes are services, and expand into nodes.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun make-dbus-explore-service-expander (bus service)
  "Create an expander that will create an overview over the services nodes."
  (lambda (widget)
    (let ((path "/"))
      (loop for node in (dbus-introspect-get-node-names bus service "/")
	    for new-path = (concat path node)
	    collect
	    (widget-convert 'tree-widget :tag node :expander (make-dbus-explore-node-expander bus service new-path))))))
#+END_SRC

All other nodes are checked for sub-nodes and interfaces.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun make-dbus-explore-node-expander (bus service path)
  "Create an expander that will create the next level of nodes of a node."
  (lambda (widget)
    (let ((child-nodes
	   (loop for node in (dbus-introspect-get-node-names bus service path)
		 for new-path = (concat path "/" node)
		 collect
		 (widget-convert 'tree-widget :tag node :expander (make-dbus-explore-node-expander bus service new-path))))
	  (interfaces
	   (loop for iface in (dbus-introspect-get-interface-names bus service path)
		 unless (and dbus-explore-hide-standard-interfaces
			   (member iface dbus-explore-standard-interfaces))
		 collect
		 (widget-convert 'tree-widget :tag (concat "I: " iface) :expander (dbus-explore-make-interface-expander bus service path iface)))))
      (append child-nodes interfaces))))
#+END_SRC

*** Interfaces
Interfaces can have multiple kinds of information: Signals, Properties
and Methods.

For signals and methods, emacs returns a parsed xml-expression.  This is formatted
into a signature as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dbus-explore-format-signal/method-node (name args)
  (let ((arg-string (string-join (loop for arg in args
				       for arg-list = (second arg)
				       collect (format "%s %s"
						       (alist-get 'type arg-list)
						       (alist-get 'name arg-list)))
				 ", ")))
    (format "%s(%s)" name arg-string)))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dbus-explore-make-interface-expander (bus service path interface)
  (lambda (widget)
    (let ((properties
 	   (loop for (property . value) in (dbus-get-all-properties bus service path interface)
 		 collect
 		 (dbus-explore-make-property-item property value)))
 	  (signals
 	   (loop for signal in (dbus-introspect-get-signal-names bus service path interface)
 		 collect
 		 (let* ((definition (dbus-introspect-get-signal bus service path interface signal)))
		   (widget-convert 'item :tag (concat "S: " (dbus-explore-format-signal/method-node signal
										       ;; get rid of strings in the xml element, only return the args nodes
												    (remove-if-not 'consp (subseq definition 2))))))))
	  ;; This is a bit unfortunate duplicate code.  Could be eliminated when working from the all-objects path, bypassing the abstractions.
	  (methods
 	   (loop for method in (dbus-introspect-get-method-names bus service path interface)
 		 collect
 		 (let* ((definition (dbus-introspect-get-method bus service path interface method)))
		   (widget-convert 'item :tag (concat "M: " (dbus-explore-format-signal/method-node method
										       ;; get rid of strings in the xml element, only return the args nodes
										       (remove-if-not 'consp (subseq definition 2)))))))))
      (append properties methods signals))))
#+END_SRC

**** Properties
Properties can be somewhat complex to display due to D-Bus' flexible
type system.  Currently, we infer only arrays of simple stuff and
dictionaries, by checking for conses and nested conses, respectively

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dbus-explore-make-property-item (bus service path interface property value)
  (let* ((type (if (consp value)
		  (if (consp (car value))
		      :dict
		    :array)
		 :simple))
	 (tag (case type
		(:simple (format "P: %s: %s" property value))
		(:array (format ("P: %s(%s)" property (length property))))
		(:dict (format ("P: %s{%s}" property (length provalue)))
	 (expandvalue type
		     (:simple nil)
		     (:array (dbus-explore-make-array-expander (bus service path interface property value)))
		     (:dict (dbus-explore-make-dict-expaner (bus service path interface property value))))))))
		     (:dict (dbus-explore-make-dict-expander bus service path interface property value)))))
    (if (eq type :simple)
	(widget-convert 'item :tag tag)
(defun dbus-explore-      -array-expander (bus service path interface property valu)e)
  "Expander that gets called when an array should be expanded"
  (lambda (widget)
    (loop for elt in value
	  for i from 0
	  collect
	  (widget-convert 'tree-widget :tag (format "%s: %s" i elt)))))

(defun dbus-explore-make-dict-expanderitemce path interface property value)
  "Expander that gets called when a dict should be expanded"
  (lambda (widget)
    (loop for (key . val) in value
	  collect
	  (widget-convert 'tree-widget :tag (format "%s: %s" key (if (and (consp val) (ll (cdr val)))
								     (car val)
	  (widget-convert 'item :tag (format "%s: %s" key (if (listp val)
#+END_SRC

** Initialization

To begin processing, simply create a (collapsed) tree-widget for each
discovered service on the bus.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dbus-explore-create-top-widgets (bus)
    (loop for name in (dbus-list-known-names bus) do
 	(widget-create 'tree-widget :tag name :expander (make-dbus-explore-service-expander bus name))))
#+END_SRC

TODO: make this interactive and fix running doc.

  (with-current-buffer (generate-new-buffer (format "*D-Bus explorer%s*" bus))
    (dbus-explore-create-top-widgets bus)
    (widget-setup)
    (switch-to-buffer (current-buffer))))
