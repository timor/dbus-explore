;; URL: https://github.com/timor/dbus-explore

;;; Commentary:
;; This is a D-Bus explorer for emacs.
;; As usual, add the file to load path and do a
;; =(require 'dbus-explore)=

;; To start, run the command =dbus-explore= and choose either =:session= or
;; =:system= as a bus to explore.

;; Click the Nodes in the explorer Buffer to browse the objects and their interfaces.
;;; Implementation:

;; * Interactive Emacs DBus Explorer

;; D-Bus objects are represented in a tree fashion, using emacs' tree
;; widget in a separate buffer, with one top-level object for each known
;; D-Bus object.

(require 'dbus)

;; ** Variables
;; All DBus objects implement some standard interfaces, hide them per default.

;; ** Tree Widget Creation
;; The tree items are created on button-click time by providing an
;; expander function to an item.  The general pattern here is to create
;; the expanders when the next item is created.  This expander-creation is
;; recursive, and creating lexical closures allows us to carry the
;; information that is needed for the next child-node in the closed-over
;; arguments for the next handler-creation.

;; The top-level nodes are services, and expand into nodes.
